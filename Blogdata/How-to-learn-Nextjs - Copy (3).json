In this article, I'll show you some tips and tricks that will help you to learn JavaScript more efficiently. Before we start, we have to set clear expectations about this article: This is not a quick hack to learn JavaScript in 10 minutes. Most programming languages, including JavaScript, take a long time to learn. While this article offers suggestions to speed up learning JavaScript, how soon you acquire deep JavaScript skills depends on how hard you're willing to work. Different people learn JavaScript at a different pace, so it's okay if it takes you a long time to learn. The most important thing is to learn it well.

Practice actively Another way to learn JavaScript fast is to practice actively. Practicing actively means you spend more time writing code than just watching or reading tutorials. Real learning happens when you move your hands and feet in activities like playing football or driving a car. Like these activities, you learn faster when you write JavaScript code on the computer. Try to write code for at least 30 minutes or one hour a day. By writing code regularly and practicing what you've learned, you will improve your JavaScript knowledge more quickly. Don't forget to take breaks on the weekends. Resting is also a crucial part of learning JavaScript. You can learn JavaScript efficiently when you are well-rested, and it helps to improve your sense of focus. Build Lots of Projects with JavaScript This one is related to active practice.

If you don't, it's still a good thing since you will discover what you don't know yet and use this information to fill the missing gaps in your JavaScript knowledge. All of this will help you to improve your JavaScript skill in the long run. Start by building simple projects that only take you few days to complete and slowly work your way up to advanced projects.
